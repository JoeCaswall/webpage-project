          I have spent a number of years in the hospitality industry, both
          behind the bar and in the kitchen, in positions from entry level to
          management.

            I most enjoyed my time working in small breweries in London, where I
            got to meet such a variety of people and learn so much about beer
            and how it's produced!

            I also enjoyed my time as a Pizza Chef on a food truck in Surrey,
            learning the ins - and - outs of bread making and dough
            manipulation; this is a skill which has made me popular among
            friends and will stick with me forever! Click on the image to check

            Now I have started an apprenticeship to learn software engineering
            and am excited to move forward with this next phase of my life! It's
            been so fun to learn a new skill again.
